# NEW FEATURE

If you are using branches with names like `TASK-321-some-description` memtask
will insert `TASK-321` before any time insert, useful when you use it with
JIRA or similar issues trackers.

Instead simple `#time 0h 4m` you will get `TASK-321 #time 0h 4m`.

Branch checked every 5 minutes and you can change it in settings.

Hotkeys for this: `ctrl+alt+i` and `ctrl+cmd+i` on OSX.

Also improved plugin start time in this release.
